# TPC-NAS: Sub-Five-Minute Neural Architecture Search for Image Classification, Object-Detection, and Super-Resolution

# ImageNet Result
![My Image](ImageNet-Result.png)

ImageNet accuracy for different NSA algorithms or man-made models. The x-coordinate is the search time, the y-coordinate is the performance of NAS on ImageNet, and the bubble size represents the model's FLOPs. Our TPC-NAS(red ball) can even achieve 76.4% ImageNet accuracy when the number of FLOPs is 355M, which outperforms most NAS algorithms. In addition, our search time is two orders less than other NAS algorithms. Hence, our NAS is very competitive in terms of search time and found modelsâ€™ performance.

## Testing
Test CIFAR10 and CIFAR100
```
sh scripts/TPC_NAS_cifar_params1M.sh
```

Test ImageNet
```
sh scripts/TPC_NAS_ImageNet_flops300M.sh
```

## Training
Modify the save_dir in the script and run the same command as testing.

Train CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 under 1M parameters size
```
sh scripts/TPC_NAS_cifar_params1M.sh
```

Train ImageNet under 300M flops
```
sh scripts/TPC_NAS_ImageNet_flops300M.sh
```
